  - Component-level caching: Memoized calculations for UI performance
  - Browser cache: Static assets and GraphQL schema cached locally
```

#### Bundle Optimization Relationships
```
Context: Code splitting and lazy loading optimize initial load times
Optimization Pattern:
  - Core bundle: Authentication + Navigation + Shared components
  - Feature bundles: Each system loaded on-demand
  - Shared utilities: Common functions bundled separately
  - Chart libraries: Lazy loaded when visualization components are needed
```

### 3. Mobile & Responsive Context

#### Touch Interaction Patterns
```
Context: Consistent touch interactions across all feature systems
Relationships:
  - 44px minimum touch targets enforced across all components
  - Swipe gestures: Budget category scrolling ↔ Goal milestone timeline ↔ Investment chart navigation
  - Long press actions: Budget editing ↔ Goal milestone creation ↔ Investment holding details
  - Pull-to-refresh: Universal pattern across all dashboard views
```

#### Responsive Layout Relationships
```
Context: Adaptive layouts that prioritize information based on screen size
Mobile-First Priorities:
  - Budget: Current spending → Category overview → Detailed allocations
  - Goals: Progress overview → Next milestone → Detailed metrics
  - Investments: Portfolio value → Top holdings → Detailed analytics
  - Debt: Total debt → Next payment → Detailed strategy
  - Banking: Account balances → Recent transactions → Connection status
```
