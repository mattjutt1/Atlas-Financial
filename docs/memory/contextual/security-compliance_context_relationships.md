The SuperTokens authentication migration represents a strategic advancement toward PCI-DSS 4.0 compliance and defense-in-depth security.

## PCI-DSS 4.0 Compliance Context

### Data Classification and Isolation
**Compliance Requirement**: PCI-DSS 4.0 requires isolation of authentication data from financial transactions
**Implementation Context**:
```
Data Domain Isolation:
├── supertokens database (Authentication Domain)
│   ├── User credentials (encrypted)
│   ├── Session tokens (time-limited)
│   ├── Authentication events (audit trail)
│   └── User metadata (non-financial)
└── firefly database (Financial Domain)
    ├── Account balances (sensitive financial data)
    ├── Transaction history (payment card data)
    ├── Financial relationships (account structures)
    └── Budgeting data (spending patterns)
```

**Context**: Complete domain separation ensures that authentication vulnerabilities cannot expose financial data, exceeding PCI-DSS minimum requirements.

**Relationship Impact**:
- No cross-database queries between authentication and financial domains
- Independent encryption keys for each data domain
- Separate backup and recovery procedures
- Isolated audit trails for compliance reporting

### Network Segmentation Context

```yaml
# Internal Docker Network (atlas-network)
Internal Services:
  - SuperTokens Core (authentication)
  - PostgreSQL (data persistence)
  - Redis (session caching)
  - Hasura (API gateway)

External Exposure (controlled):
  - Frontend (port 3000) → Authentication UI
  - SuperTokens API (port 3567) → Dashboard only
  - Hasura Console (port 8081) → Admin access only
```

**Context**: Network segmentation isolates sensitive services while providing controlled external access for legitimate operations.

**Compliance Relationship**: Meets PCI-DSS requirements for network segmentation and access control.

## Authentication Security Context

### Multi-Layer Authentication Protection
**Defense in Depth Strategy**:
1. **Database Layer**: Encrypted credential storage with salted hashes
