# Contextual Memory: Docker Infrastructure Context & Relationships

## Infrastructure Philosophy

The Docker Compose setup embodies the **"Self-Hosted First"** principle from the PRD, ensuring every component can run locally without external dependencies. This creates a complete development environment that mirrors production deployment patterns.

## Service Relationship Context

### PostgreSQL as Central Hub
**Context**: PostgreSQL serves as the single source of truth for all services, but with logical separation
**Relationships** (UPDATED July 27, 2025):
- **Firefly III**: Uses `firefly` database for double-entry accounting ledger
- **Hasura**: Uses `firefly` database for GraphQL API generation + `hasura` database for metadata
- **SuperTokens**: Uses `supertokens` database for authentication data (PCI-DSS compliant isolation)
- **Grafana**: Uses `grafana` database for dashboard persistence (alternative to SQLite)

**Design Rationale**: Single PostgreSQL instance reduces operational complexity while maintaining data isolation through separate databases. This supports the PRD requirement for "99.5% uptime" by minimizing moving parts.

### Authentication Flow Context (UPDATED July 27, 2025)
**SuperTokens → JWT → Hasura Chain**:
```
User Login → SuperTokens Core (issues JWT with Hasura claims) → Frontend (SuperTokens React SDK) → Hasura (validates JWT via JWKS) → PostgreSQL (row-level security)
```

**Migration Context**: Complete migration from NextAuth + Keycloak to SuperTokens self-hosted solution achieves:
- **PCI-DSS 4.0 Compliance**: Authentication data isolated in dedicated `supertokens` database
- **Data Sovereignty**: Complete self-hosted authentication stack
- **Performance Optimization**: Sub-50ms JWT verification with JWKS endpoint
- **Enterprise Security**: Rotating JWT keys with built-in CSRF protection

**Relationship Implications**:
- SuperTokens failure = Complete auth failure (single point of failure by design, but more reliable)
- JWT/Session management through SuperTokens React SDK with HttpOnly cookies
- Hasura validates JWTs via SuperTokens JWKS endpoint at `http://supertokens:3567/recipe/jwt/jwks`
- Session persistence and refresh handled automatically by SuperTokens

### SuperTokens Service Architecture Context (NEW July 27, 2025)
**Container Configuration**:
```yaml
supertokens:
  image: registry.supertokens.io/supertokens/supertokens-postgresql:9.2
  container_name: atlas-supertokens
  environment:
    POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION_URI: "postgresql://atlas:password@postgres:5432/supertokens"
    API_KEYS: atlassupertokensapikey123
    SUPERTOKENS_HOST: "0.0.0.0"
    SUPERTOKENS_PORT: 3567
  ports:
    - "3567:3567"
```

**Service Dependencies**:
- **Depends On**: PostgreSQL (requires `supertokens` database)
- **Used By**: Frontend Web service for authentication API
- **Integrates With**: Hasura for JWT verification via JWKS endpoint
- **Redis Integration**: Uses Redis for session caching (performance optimization)

**Database Schema Context**: SuperTokens creates 9 authentication tables:
- `all_auth_recipe_users`: Central user registry
- `emailpassword_users`: Email/password authentication data
- `session_info`: Active user sessions
- `jwt_signing_keys`: JWT key rotation management
- `user_metadata`: Additional user information
- `user_roles`: Role-based access control
- `role_permissions`: Permission mappings

**Security Isolation Context**:
- Authentication data completely isolated from financial data
- Meets PCI-DSS 4.0 requirements for sensitive data segregation
- No cross-database queries between `supertokens` and `firefly` databases

### AI Engine Integration Context
**Context**: The AI Engine is designed as a **batch processing service** rather than real-time
**Relationships**:
- **Input**: Queries Firefly data via Hasura GraphQL (ensures same access controls)
- **Processing**: Local LLM model for privacy compliance (no external API calls)
- **Output**: Stores insights back to PostgreSQL via Hasura mutations
- **Scheduling**: Will be triggered by cron jobs or user requests, not real-time

**Design Rationale**: Batch processing aligns with "Time to First Insight in <60 seconds" requirement - AI runs regularly but not on every transaction. This prevents performance bottlenecks while maintaining fresh insights.

### Data Flow Relationship Patterns

#### Transaction Ingestion Flow
```
Bank APIs → Data Ingestion Service → Firefly III API → PostgreSQL → Hasura (live subscription) → Frontend (real-time update)
```
**Context**: This flow supports the "75/15/10 budget rule" enforcement by providing immediate visibility into spending changes.

#### Insight Generation Flow
```
PostgreSQL → Hasura → AI Engine → Local LLM → AI Engine → PostgreSQL → Hasura → Frontend
```
**Context**: The round-trip through Hasura ensures AI-generated insights follow the same security model as user-generated data.

## Infrastructure Scaling Context

### Development → Production Evolution
**Current (Development)**:
- Single-node Docker Compose
- Shared PostgreSQL instance
- Local file storage for models/uploads

**Future (Production)**:
- Kubernetes deployment (infrastructure/k8s/)
- PostgreSQL cluster with read replicas
- Distributed file storage (S3-compatible)

**Relationship Impact**: The current container structure is production-ready; only the orchestration layer changes. This supports the PRD's "single household to small business" scaling requirement.

### Resource Allocation Context
**Memory-Intensive Services**:
- **AI Engine**: Requires GPU/high-CPU for LLM inference
- **PostgreSQL**: Scales with transaction volume (linear growth)

**Network-Intensive Services**:
- **Hasura**: High throughput for GraphQL subscriptions
- **Firefly III**: Moderate API traffic

**Storage-Intensive Services**:
- **PostgreSQL**: Financial data (high-value, critical backup needs)
- **AI Engine**: Model files (large, cacheable, version-controlled)

## Security Boundary Context

### Trust Zone Architecture
```
Internet → Reverse Proxy (future) → Frontend → Hasura → PostgreSQL
                                   ↘ Keycloak ↗
```

**Context**: The current development setup assumes trusted network (localhost). Production will add reverse proxy with SSL termination and rate limiting.

### Data Sovereignty Implications
**Critical Decision**: All sensitive data remains within the Docker network
**Relationships**:
- **Firefly III**: Financial transactions never leave local environment
- **AI Engine**: LLM processing happens locally (no OpenAI API calls)
- **Keycloak**: User credentials stored in self-hosted database

**Compliance Context**: This architecture supports both GDPR compliance and the "Privacy-Maxi Self-Hoster" persona from the PRD.

## Operational Context

### Health Check Strategy
**Context**: Every service has health checks to support automated recovery
**Relationships**:
- **Dependency Chain**: Frontend → Hasura → PostgreSQL
- **Independent Services**: Keycloak, Grafana can restart independently
- **Critical Path**: PostgreSQL failure brings down entire system

### Backup and Recovery Context
**Data Criticality Hierarchy**:
1. **PostgreSQL Data**: Financial transactions (irreplaceable)
2. **Keycloak Data**: User accounts (recoverable but disruptive)
3. **AI Models**: Large files (re-downloadable)
4. **Grafana Dashboards**: Configuration (re-creatable)

**Relationship Impact**: Backup strategy must prioritize PostgreSQL data, with automated daily backups and point-in-time recovery.

## Development Experience Context

### Hot Reload Relationships
**Frontend Development**: Next.js hot reload independent of backend services
**Backend Development**: API changes require service restarts but not full stack reset
**Database Schema Changes**: Require Hasura metadata refresh and potential Firefly III migrations

### Debugging Context
**Service Debugging Order**:
1. Check PostgreSQL connectivity
2. Verify Keycloak realm configuration
3. Test Hasura GraphQL endpoint
4. Validate Firefly III API responses
5. Debug AI Engine processing

**Log Aggregation**: All services log to stdout for Docker Compose log collection

## Future Integration Context

### Bank API Integration Points
**Current**: Placeholders in environment variables
**Future**: Data ingestion services will be added as separate containers
**Relationship**: These services will interact with Firefly III API, not directly with PostgreSQL

### Monitoring Integration
**Current**: Grafana configured for basic dashboards
**Future**: Prometheus + Loki stack for comprehensive observability
**Relationship**: Monitoring services will be non-critical path (system functions without them)

## Risk Mitigation Context

### Single Points of Failure
**PostgreSQL**: Mitigated by automated backups and documented recovery procedures
**Keycloak**: Mitigated by session clustering in production (multiple instances)
**AI Engine**: Graceful degradation (system works without AI insights)

### Resource Exhaustion
**Memory**: AI Engine isolated with memory limits
**Storage**: Automated cleanup of old transaction data and AI model caches
**Network**: Rate limiting in production reverse proxy

## UPDATED: Phase 1 Core Ledger MVP COMPLETE (July 25, 2025)

### Complete System Integration Achieved
**Context**: The Atlas Financial platform successfully transitioned from infrastructure-only (Phase 0) to a fully operational Core Ledger MVP (Phase 1) with end-to-end data flow.

#### Backend Integration Pipeline Complete
**Integration Context**: Using the atlas-ledger-integrator agent, the complete backend data pipeline was established:

```
PostgreSQL (74 Financial Tables) → Firefly III (Personal Finance Manager) → Hasura GraphQL (API Gateway) → Ready for Frontend
```

**Relationship Achievement**: This creates the foundational data flow supporting the PRD's "brutally honest financial picture" principle with:
- Double-entry accounting via Firefly III
- Secure API access via Hasura GraphQL
- Multi-user support via proper database relationships
- Real-time data access via GraphQL subscriptions

#### Frontend-Backend Integration Complete
**Integration Context**: Using the nextjs-atlas-frontend agent, the React/Next.js frontend was fully connected to live backend services:

**Data Flow Verified**:
```
User Interface → Apollo GraphQL Client → Hasura API → PostgreSQL → Real Financial Data Display
```

**Relationship Impact**: This eliminates the development-production gap by using real data throughout the development cycle, supporting the PRD's "Time to First Insight in <60 seconds" requirement.

#### Authentication Infrastructure Established
**Current Context**: Keycloak identity provider is operational with PostgreSQL backend, providing foundation for:
- User registration and management
- Session handling and security
- JWT token generation for API access
- Role-based access control preparation

**Security Relationship**: While Atlas realm configuration is pending (Phase 1.1), the security infrastructure supports the "Privacy-Maxi Self-Hoster" persona by keeping all identity data local.
