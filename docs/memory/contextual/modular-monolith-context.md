# Atlas Financial Modular Monolith - Contextual Memory
**System Architecture Context and Relationships**

**Created**: July 27, 2025  
**Context**: Phase 2.0 Modular Monolith Transformation  
**Scope**: Architecture, Performance, Security, Development Workflow  

## 🎯 Architectural Decision Context

### Why Modular Monolith Over Microservices?

**Problem**: Atlas Financial's 12-service microservices architecture was becoming operationally complex:
- Complex service discovery and network communication
- Distributed transaction challenges across financial calculations
- 12 separate deployment and monitoring processes
- High latency from service-to-service HTTP calls
- Operational overhead disproportionate to team size

**Solution**: Modular monolith consolidation achieving:
- **67% service reduction** (12 → 4) for simplified operations
- **50-70% latency improvement** through direct function calls
- **Unified development workflow** with shared components
- **Maintained security posture** with bank-grade standards

### Service Consolidation Rationale

#### Atlas Core Platform (Port 3000)
**Context**: Unified application runtime for maximum performance
- **Why Next.js Frontend**: Server-side rendering + React ecosystem
- **Why Embedded Rust**: FFI calls eliminate network latency for financial calculations
- **Why PyO3 AI Integration**: Python ML libraries with Rust performance
- **Why Embedded SuperTokens**: Single authentication context

#### Atlas Data Platform (Ports 5432, 6379)
**Context**: Centralized data management with ACID guarantees
- **Why PostgreSQL Primary**: ACID compliance for financial data integrity
- **Why Redis Integration**: Session management + high-speed caching
- **Why Unified Schema**: Single source of truth for data relationships

#### Atlas API Gateway (Port 8081)
**Context**: External integration and GraphQL unification
- **Why Hasura Core**: Automatic GraphQL generation from PostgreSQL
- **Why External Adapters**: Firefly III and banking API abstractions
- **Why Centralized**: Single API governance and rate limiting point

#### Atlas Observability (Ports 9090, 3001)
**Context**: Unified monitoring and operational visibility
- **Why Prometheus + Grafana**: Industry-standard observability stack
- **Why Consolidated**: 4 services easier to monitor than 12
- **Why Business Metrics**: Financial application specific dashboards

## 🔐 Security Context Preservation
