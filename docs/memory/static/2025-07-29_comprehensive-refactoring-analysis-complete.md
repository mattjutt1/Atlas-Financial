- **Architecture Agent**: `systems-architect` - Architectural integrity and design pattern analysis
- **Framework**: SuperClaude intelligent delegation with parallel focus areas
- **Scope**: 847 files analyzed across entire codebase

### Analysis Phases Completed
1. **Discovery Phase**: Complete codebase inventory and pattern identification
2. **Assessment Phase**: Code quality metrics and architectural violation detection
3. **Strategic Planning**: Multi-phase roadmap with priority classification
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive findings and implementation guidance

## Critical Findings Summary

### 1. Shared Library Underutilization (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: @atlas/shared library exists but not utilized effectively
- **Impact**: 2,300+ lines of duplicate code across applications
- **Evidence**: Financial calculations, validation logic, and utilities duplicated in:
  - `apps/desktop/src/utils/`
  - `apps/web/src/lib/utils/`
  - `apps/ai-cfo/src/utils/`
  - `services/portfolio/src/utils/`

### 2. Financial Precision Foundation Fragmentation (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Financial calculations implemented 4 different ways
- **Risk**: Precision inconsistencies, calculation errors, audit compliance failures
- **Locations**:
  - Portfolio service: Custom precision handling
  - Web app: Client-side calculations with different rounding
  - Desktop app: Native financial libraries
  - AI CFO: ML-optimized calculations

### 3. Legacy Microservices Persistence (HIGH)
- **Issue**: Legacy microservices still present despite modular monolith migration
- **Impact**: Defeats architectural benefits, increases operational complexity
- **Evidence**:
  - `services/legacy-auth/` (replaced by `services/auth/`)
  - `services/old-portfolio/` (replaced by `services/portfolio/`)
  - Dead code in deployment configurations

### 4. Architectural Pattern Violations (HIGH)
- **AI CFO Service**: Direct database access bypassing domain services
- **Desktop App**: Business logic in presentation layer
- **Web Frontend**: Inconsistent state management patterns
- **API Gateway**: Inconsistent error handling and response formats
